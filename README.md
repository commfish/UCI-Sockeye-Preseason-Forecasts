# UCI-Sockeye-Preseason-Forecast
UCI sockeye preseason forecasts include Fish Creek, Kenai River, Kasilof River, and Susitna River. 
The original codes, except Susitna River, were SAS progams written by Mark Willett. Susitna stock was originally in Excel.
Xinxian Zhang modified and converted them to R cripts.
One R script is to forecast the next year's salmon runs; the other one is to examine model fit with different model selection criteria.
